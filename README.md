### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end developer from Yogyakarta, Indonesia

I'm experienced in website development since 2018 as a full stack developer I sometimes analyze software. 
But now I'm also developing website applications using `VueJs/NuxtJs`. 

**I also can do ...**

- Pretty good analysis to design project flow,
- Designing a database structure,
- Creating a website, and mobile app flow is my favorite job,
- I am a fun person and can adapt to any environment.
